# C# WPF chat
## Information
This chat application was developed using WPF framework, and built in System.Net and System.Net.Sockets libraries. 
The chat is working without a proxy server so the connection is made directly between two IP endpoints, nothing is in between.

### Step II:
Now the app is waiting for your friend to connect. Tell your friend to connect you. In this case, he will have to set his port to 8002 and his friend's port (your port) to 8000. In addition he should set the friend's IP to your ip address (In this case we are using the localhost IP so it is the same for both clients)
